🔬 Lung Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project aims to analyze and predict the presence of lung cancer using a machine learning approach. The notebook walks through data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation of classifiers to detect lung cancer risk based on medical and lifestyle features.

📁 File Included
lung cancer problem.ipynb: A complete Jupyter notebook containing:

Data loading and cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature selection and transformation

Model training (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)

Performance metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.)

📊 Techniques Used
Pandas & NumPy for data handling

Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

Scikit-learn for machine learning models

Label Encoding and train-test split

🎯 Objective
To develop a reliable prediction model that can assist in early detection of lung cancer and support clinical decision-making using simple health indicators.

📌 How to Run
Clone this repository

Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
